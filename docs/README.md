# Explore concepts for a plugable event library.

# Background 

Often there seems to be a conceptual gap between events, metrics and tracing.  Basic definition:

- Event  -  A specific occurrence and represent the state of the system.
- Metric - The measurement of a specific value.
- Tracing - Provide timing measurements of a span.

Tracing - [Google Dapper](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub36356) implementations
